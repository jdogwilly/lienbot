# Lien Bot 
_A Chat Bot for assisting with filling liens and related papers_

## Aims
* Aimed at smaller companies (<20 employees) 
* Asks questions to fill in a lien
* Allow for E-filing if possible
* Allow for direct mailing to GC’s and Property Owners as required
* Gives rules about liens, like if notices are required and when you can file
* Monetize: A portion of collected lines
    * Perhaps make it a non-profit just to help smaller companies
    * `Democratize` liens and help contractors be protected from GC’s “screwing” them
* Start with Georgia
* Work with lawyers to get a good proper form for filing
* Allow for sending an “Intent to File” with fancy language and pretty paper
* Maybe a project tracker too `¯\_(ツ)_/¯ `
